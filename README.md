# CS5228-Project
This is the code of Group `Kimberley` for `CS5228` Data Mining Project.

## Setup
To run our code, please make sure the package of Juypter, Sklearn, Keras, Tensorflow, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy are installed in your working environment.

## Instruction

### Task 1 - Prediction of Car Resale Prices

You can run the `EDA_task1.ipynb` to run the EDA adn get the traning and test data for task 1.

You can run the `project-task1-notebook.ipynb` to train the data mining models for task 1.

### Task 2 - Car Recommendation

You can run the `EDA_task2.ipynb` to run the EDA adn get the preprocessed data for task 2.

You can run the `project-task2-notebook-track1.ipynb` to perform the data mining algorithm for task2-track1 (Using Pairwise Item-Item Similarity).

You can run the `project-task2-notebook-track2.ipynb` to perform the data mining algorithm for task2-track2 (Using User-Item Similarity).

### Task 3 - Prediction of Actual Depreciation Rate of Used Car

You can run the `EDA_task3.ipynb` to run the EDA adn get the traning and test data for task 3.

You can run the `project-task3-notebook.ipynb` to train the data mining models for task 3.
